# Password Strength Checker 

A simple Python script to check the strength of a password based on basic rules:
- Minimum length of 8 characters
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one number
- At least one special character (!@#$%^&*()_+)

## How It Works
The script gives a score from 0 to 5 and displays:
- **Very Weak**
- **Weak**
- **Moderate**
- **Strong**
- **Very Strong**

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Save the script as `password_checker.py`.
3. Run in the terminal:
   ```bash
   python password_checker.py
